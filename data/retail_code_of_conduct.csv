# CODE OF CONDUCT
Wholesale Club Code of Business Conduct

Wholesale Club is dedicated to ensuring that its products are manufactured under conditions which reflect our commitment to human rights in the workplace. As a global corporation, we support internationally recognized norms for the safety and well being of the employees who are responsible for the manufacture of our products, and we believe that it is incumbent upon our business to ensure that the employees' working environments around the globe meet or exceed these norms. This policy is intended to implement standards which are fair, reflect marketplace conditions, are appropriate to the variety of cultures and peoples which are an important part of our success as a brand, and encourage self-respect amongst our suppliers' and vendors' employees with a sense of pride and accomplishment. Compliance with Laws and Regulations
Wholesale Club prefers, as a matter of policy, to do business with Vendors/Suppliers who meet or exceed the standards set by the applicable laws and regulations relating to employee rights and working conditions. Vendors/Suppliers must, at a minimum, comply with all applicable laws and regulations including but not limited to age, hours of work, minimum wage, overtime, provisions for vacation and holidays, pregnancy and maternity leave, and required retirement benefits. If an industry standard is higher than the legal minimum, Vendors/Suppliers must meet the industry standard. In lieu of the industry standard or legal minimum, Vendors/Suppliers must comply with all applicable laws and regulations relating to the exportation and importation of merchandise including country of origin, labeling, customs classifications and valuation and all laws prohibiting counterfeiting trademarks or transshipment of merchandise. Hours of Work/Overtime/Days Off/Holidays
Wholesale Club prefers to do business with Vendors/Suppliers who do not require more than 60 hour workweeks on a regular basis. Except in extraordinary circumstances, employees shall not be required to work in excess of 48 hours per week and 12 hours overtime, and shall be entitled to at least one day of rest during a consecutive 24 hours, off in every 7 day period. Full-time employees must have a minimum of two weeks, or level stated in local law, whichever is higher, paid annual leave. Wages/Benefits
Wholesale Club will seek business partners who share our commitment to the betterment of wage and benefit levels that address the basic needs of workers and their families so far as possible and appropriate in light of national, regional, and industry practices and conditions. Employees must be paid at least the cash equivalent of the minimum legal wage or a wage that is consistent with local industry standards, whichever is greater.",1
"Legally permissible deductions for benefits provided to the employee may not effectively reduce the wages and benefits to a level which prohibits the employee from providing the basic needs for the employee and his or her family. Wages should be paid directly to the employee in cash, a check or equivalent; information relating to wages should be available to employees in an understandable form, with accurate and complete records, kept according to generally accepted accounting principles, available for inspection. Wage rates for overtime or any time exceeding 48 hours in a given work week should be at such premium rate as is legally required, but in any event should be higher than the rates for regular hours.
